Today I figured out how to get the last post to show up
on the index page.  It's only one component of the overall
plan, but it is a nice start.

Next steps I think are to style the widget appropriately.
After that I want to move towards getting a widget up that
contains my GitHub statistics.  I also really should get my
logo in place.
