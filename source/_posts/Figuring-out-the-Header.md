Today I started to figure out exactly how to go about
customizing Hexo.  I managed to get in a few customizations.

I want to make it so the latest post shows up on the home page.
Soon enough I will make that happen.  One of the biggest challenges for
now is using technologies that I'm either not as up to date on or completely
inexperienced at it.  For instance EJS and Stylus.
