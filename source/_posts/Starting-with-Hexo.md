I'm trying out the Hexo static site blog generator.

So far it's pretty nice.  Today I successfully added the
`hexo-generator-cname` plugin so that the CNAME file would be
generated so GitHub pages doesn't get the custom domain
destroyed after each deploy.

The next step I plan to do is replace this page with an actual
landing page.  I want to put my current open source contributions
on it as well as a list of these blog posts.

I hope to be a bit more prolific in my writing.  I plan to keep
updating this as I build out the site and as I come across other
problems that I solve I hope to give insights into how I
solve them.
